    <para>The location of each note is motivated by the fact that the lowest row of characters
        just above the space bar has exactly <emphasis role="bold">seven letters</emphasis>: the
        seven pitches of a diatonic scale.</para>
    
    <para>It is easy to learn where this seven notes are because their physical location on
        the keyboard.</para>

    <para>Most musicians aren't happy with just seven notes. Following the idea above, we get a
        new octave for each of the four rows of the keyboard above the space bar, with the top
        row having three additional notes, like this:</para>

    <note>
        <para>Notice each column of keyboard keys maps to the same note in different octaves.</para>
    </note>
    
    <para>If you have used other notation software, you are probably used to look
        for the <cav:computer-key>C</cav:computer-key> key if you want to write a <emphasis
            role="italic">C</emphasis>, and so on. This is not very efficient, because
        sadly these letters aren’t ordered in such order in a row. When writing notes
        with Cavatina, once you get your fingers placed in the right position, you have
        all notes you need at your fingertips and you don’t have to look
        back down at the keyboard.
