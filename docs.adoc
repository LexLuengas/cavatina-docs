Cavatina is a font family for quickly writing musical notation. It focuses on speed of input and portability and is
primarly suited for quick drafting of ideas or music teaching. The fonts can be used in any text editor that supports 
advanced font features or included as a webfont in a browser.

The idea behind Cavatina is that you don't necessarily need a heavy-weight music notation program to draft musical ideas.
Instead, music is typed in as normal text based on a specific keyboard scheme.

The Cavatina project is open source and free under the MIT license. You can grab a copy of the fonts and related tools on the link:[GitHub realease page].

[NOTE]
Cavatina works with the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and Opera, so make sure to use one of those browsers to read this documentation.

== Learning Cavatina

For learning how to write music with Cavatina you have a few options, although it is strongly recommended that you do read the sections <<The Basics>> and <<The Musical Note>> beforehand. You can

- do the link:{link-tutorial}[tutorial],
- read on through this documentation, or
- look at the link:{link-keyboard-mapping}[keyboard mapping] itself.

== The Basics

The order in which you type in music in Cavatina matters. You write _sequentially_ from left to right, as in written
language. But music is similar to written language in many other ways: chords are like words, bar-lines are like punctuation marks, accidentals
are like diacritical marks and the staff lines are the space character. That is exactly how you should think when writing with Cavatina. 

There are only three basic rules to keep in mind when writing with Cavatina:

1.  Hitting space extends the staff for starting a new note or chord.
2.  Notes within a chord are typed in _from low to high_.
3.  Note modifiers are written directly _after_ the corresponding note.

The rest of learning Cavatina is really only memorizing the location on the keyboard of each musical symbol.

== The Musical Note

The location of each note on the keyboard is motivated by the fact that the lowest row
of characters just above the space bar has exactly *seven letters*: the
seven pitches of a diatonic scale.

endif::[]

endif::[]

It is easy to learn where this seven notes are due to their physical
location on the keyboard.

Most musicians aren't happy with just seven notes. Following the idea
above, we get a new octave for each of the four rows of the keyboard
above the space bar, with the top row having three additional notes,
like this:

[NOTE]
Each column of keyboard keys maps to the same note in different
octaves.

If you have used other notation software, you are probably used to look
for the `C` key if you want to write a _C_, and so on. This is not very
efficient, because sadly these letters aren’t ordered in a
row. When writing notes with Cavatina, once you get your fingers placed
in the right position, you don’t need to look back down at the keyboard.

=== Note length

So far we have 31 notes (covering a bit more than four octaves). Each of
these characters has its lowercase and uppercase variant, which
correspond to the note in 8^th^ and 4^th^ length accordingly. Switching
to the bold weight of Cavatina, you get 16^th^-notes in the lowercase
and 8^th^-notes in the uppercase characters.

[TIP]
Use a keyboard shortcut to switch to the bold weight (on an interface in English use kbd:[Ctrl/Cmd+B]).

[%autowidth]
|====
| | Sample Input | Note length

.2+|Regular style 
| `a` | 8^th^
| `A` | 4^th^
.2+|Bold style 
| `pass:q[*a*]` | 16^th^
| `pass:q[*A*]` | 8^th^

Appart from that, Cavatina has a special key that serves as a _modifier
key_: the `{backtick}`/`{tilde}` key. We are going to call `{backtick}` the _inverter_ and `{tilde}` the
_time_ character, the latter of which, among other things, extends the
duration of notes. Every time you hit the time character after a note, the
note’s length doubles. You can do this up to a maximum of twice per
note, i.e. for a whole note you would need to type a 4^th^-note followed
by two times `{tilde}`.

For *dotted notes* you use `<` after the note.

To draw a *tie* after a note append an `L`.

=== Note orientation

The stem of a note can be inverted. This is done with the _inverter_ `{backtick}`. A
note can only be inverted once (which doesn’t stop you from
un-inverting).

To invert the stem of a chord you invert the first note of the chord. If
the next note in the chord would collide in its default orientation,
then it is automatically inverted. Otherwise keep inverting until you
obtain the desired result. This is useful for separating voices within
one chord.

=== Rests

Rests are accessed via the `]`/`}` key. Their duration is changed the
same way as for notes. Optionally, you can write the same rest twice and
the length will increase accordingly.

.Rests

| Input | Output

|`pass:a[, {endsb} }  {endsb}{endsb} }}  {endsb}~ {endsb}~~ }~ }~~,]`

=== Note beams

To beam two 8^th^ or 16^th^ notes, write two dots `..` after the second
note. Both notes need to have the same orientation before they can be
beamed. Only pairs of notes can be beamed together.

== Staff and Barlines

When you hit the spacebar you draw a new staff _block_. Before any note
or chord, you have to draw a new staff block to make room for a note or a chord.

The barlines are mapped as follows:

[%autowidth]
|====
|Musical symbol |Raw input

| simple barline | `,`
| double barline | `,,`
| final barline | `.`
| repeat barline (start) | `;`
| repeat barline (end) | `:`
|====

Cavatina is not made to do minor adjustments to the layout, but if you
consider it necessary, you can gain control over horizontal spacing by
using the half space `/` and the quarter space `//`.

.Barlines
====
|====
| Input | Output

| `pass:[, ,, . ; :]` 
ifndef::env-github[]
| [.cavatina]#, ,, . ; :#
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]
a| image::example_6.png[]
endif::[]
|====
====

== Clefs

Cavatina supports three different clefs:

[%autowidth]
|====
| Musical symbol | Raw input

| F-clef | `pass:[_]`
| C-Clef | `pass:[_+]` or `pass:[+_]`
| G-Clef | `pass:[+]`
|====

The input of the notes is invariant of the signature; it doesn’t depend
on the current clef.

.Clefs
====
|====
| Input | Output

| `pass:[,+ f f,_ f f,+_ f f,]` 
ifndef::env-github[]
| [.cavatina]#,+ f f,_ f f,+_ f f,#
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]
a| image::example_7.png[]
endif::[]
|====
====

== Time Signatures

Time signatures have to be written after clefs (and key signatures) or
barlines. To start a time signature enter the _time_ key `{tilde}`. After that
you just write the upper and lower numeral successively.

To write the _common time_ or _cut time_ symbols, enter `c` or `C` after
the _time_ key.

A space is automatically attached after a time signature, so that you
don’t have to open a new staff block yourself.

.Time signatures
====
|====
| Input | Output

| `pass:[,~34 ,~1216 ,_---~34 ,~c ,]` 
ifndef::env-github[]
| [.cavatina]#pass:[,~34 ,~1216 ,_---~34 ,~c ,]#
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]
a| image::example_8.png[]

== Accidentals and Key Signatures

[%autowidth]
|====
| Musical symbol | Raw input

| flat	        | `pass:[-]`
| sharp	        | `pass:[=]`
| natural	    | `pass:[-=]` or `pass:[=-]`
| double flat	| `pass:[--]`
| double sharp	| `pass:[==]`
|====

To write a key signature you simply type in the sharps/flats successively after a clef.

.Key signatures
====
|====
| Input | Output

| `pass:[_----- D G,_+== ADG ]` 
ifndef::env-github[]
| [.cavatina]#pass:[_----- D G,_+== ADG ]#
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]

== Articulations

[%autowidth]
|====
| Musical symbol | Raw input

| staccato | `+'+`
| tenuto | `+"+`
| staccatissimo | `+''+`
| fermata | `+""+`
| accent | `+>+`
|====

All articulations are written after the lowest note of a chord, except
the fermata, which is written after the highest note.

.Articulations
====
|====
| Input | Output

| `pass:a[{nbsp}{nbsp}A' A" A'' A"" A>]` 
ifndef::env-github[]
| [.cavatina]#pass:[  A' A" A'' A"" A>]#
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]
a| image::example_10.png[]
endif::[]
|====
====

== Dynamics

Dynamics are aligned with respect to the note to which they are applied.
Therefore, if you are writing a chord with some dynamics marking, you
should write that marking just after the first (lowest) note of the
chord.

.Note dynamics
[%autowidth]
[separator=¦]
|====
¦ Musical symbol ¦ Raw input

¦ pianississimo ¦ `{backslash}{backslash}{backslash}`
¦ pianissimo ¦ `{backslash}{backslash}`
¦ piano ¦ `{backslash}`
¦ mezzo piano ¦ `{backslash}|`
¦ mezzo forte ¦ `|{backslash}`
¦ forte ¦ `|`
¦ fortissimo ¦ `||`
¦ fortississimo ¦ `|||`
¦ sforzando ¦ `||{backslash}` or `{backslash}{backslash}|`
¦ forte-piano ¦ `{backslash}{backslash}{backslash}|` or `|||{backslash}` or `{backslash}{backslash}{backtick}` or `||{backtick}`

== Ornaments

[%autowidth]
|====
| Musical symbol | Raw input

| mordent | `[`
| inv. mordent | `[{backtick}`
| trill | `[[`
| turn | `{`
| inv. turn | `{{backtick}`
| arpeggio | `P`
|====

Note that, intuitively enough, ornaments are inverted with the
_inverter_ key `{backtick}`.

To extend the trill or the arpeggio repeat that same character. The
arpeggio is written at the end of a chord.

.Ornaments
====
|====
| Input | Output

| `pass:[  D[ D{ D[` D{` D[[ D[[[[ ]` 
ifndef::env-github[]
| [.cavatina]#pass:[  D[ D{ D[` D{` D[[ D[[[[ ]#
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]
a| image::example_12.png[]
endif::[]
|====
====

== Repetition markings

Apart from the repeat barlines `;`/`:`, you can use the following
repetition markings:

[%autowidth]
|====
| Musical symbol | Raw input

| 1^st^ repetition | `o`
| 2^nd^ repetition | `oo`
| end marking | `o{backtick}`
|====

The end marking is necessary for the MusicXML/MIDI converter to detect
the range of the repetition sections.

[%autowidth]
|====
| Musical symbol | Raw input

| coda | `i`
| segno | `I`
| D.C. | `k`
| D.S. | `K`
|====

Writing _coda_ or _segno_ right after _D.C._ or _D.S._ will append the
words "`al Coda`" and "`al Fine`" accordingly.

.Repetition Markings
====
|====
| Input | Output

| `pass:[, D F G Do, D F D Go`:oo  D S A }.]` 
ifndef::env-github[]
| [.cavatina]#pass:[, D F G Do, D F D Go`:oo  D S A }.]#
endif::[]
ifdef::env-github[]
a| image::example_13.png[]
endif::[]
|====
====

== Other Notation

Octave markings are used in a similar manner as repetition markings and
always after the highest note in a chord.

[%autowidth]
|====
| Musical symbol | Raw input

| 8^va^ | `O`
| 8^va^ (2) | `OO`
| end 8^va^ | `O{backtick}`
|====

The triplet is written before the chord sequence. Use tight spacing to
fit the notes under the mark: enter three quarter-spaces `///` between
the notes.

[%autowidth]
|====
| Musical symbol | Raw input

| triplet | `?`
|====

Pedal markings are lower markings and as such they have to be applied to
the first note of a chord.

[%autowidth]
|====
| Musical symbol | Raw input

| pedal | `p`
| release pedal | `pp`
|====

== Staff Systems

To create systems of multiple staves you can extend barlines to join
with the upper staff. To draw a _grand staff_, first enter a newline
followed by a single barline `,` to start a new staff. To draw the brace
connecting with the upper staff, type in `{backslash}{backslash}`. Then continue with the
clef and key signature as you would normally do. To connect the
subsequent barlines, write a single `{backslash}` after them.

[%autowidth]
|====
| Musical symbol | Raw input

| brace | `,{backslash}{backslash}`
| long barlines | `,{backslash}` or `.{backslash}` etc.
